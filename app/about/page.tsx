      </h1>
      <span className='text-slate-400'>
        I'm a third year computer science and cognitive science double major, looking to minor in neuroscience as well! I love neural systems, and I'm looking to learn all about deep learning and how to build intelligent systems through the brain.
        <br/>
        I've also taken an interest in frontend development, after putting my first project online I couldn't get enough! Recently I've been learning React and Next.js, it's amazing how many tools there are.
